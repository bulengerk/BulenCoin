# BulenCoin press and promo blurbs (English)

## Press release (tech media)
**Title:** “BulenCoin launches ultra-light Proof of Stake network for everyday hardware”
**Body (short):**
BulenCoin, an experimental Proof of Stake network, is now live with clients that run on phones, laptops, servers, and Raspberry Pi. The prototype includes a JavaScript node, block explorer, status service, rewards hub, and SDKs (JS/Rust). No mining rigs required: small validator committees, device-aware rewards, and optional superlight mode for mobile. Public repos ship full-stack tests, installers, and Docker. Live explorer/status: <your URLs>. Contact: <you@yourdomain>.

## Hacker News post
**Title:** “Show HN: BulenCoin – lightweight PoS that runs on phones, laptops, and servers”
**Text:**
We built a PoS prototype aimed at “everyday hardware” (phone → Pi → server). JS node, explorer, status service, rewards hub, JS/Rust SDKs. Small committees, device-class weighting, superlight mobile profile (prunes aggressively). Full-stack tests and installers in the repo. Live demo: API <url>, explorer <url>, status <url>. Feedback on performance/security welcome; code is experimental and open.

## Reddit (r/cryptodevs / r/selfhosted)
**Title:** “Lightweight PoS you can self-host on a phone, Pi, or laptop (BulenCoin prototype)”
**Body:**
- Node.js client, block explorer, status service, rewards hub, JS/Rust SDKs.
- Profiles: desktop/server full, gateway, Pi, mobile light/superlight (battery/data aware).
- Small validator committees, device-class reward weighting, optional superlight observer mode.
- One-command installers + Docker; full-stack tests in repo.
- Live endpoints: API <url>, explorer <url>, status <url>.
Code is experimental; looking for feedback on perf, security, and ops.

## Twitter/X thread (3–4 tweets)
1) We built BulenCoin: a lightweight PoS that runs on phones, laptops, servers, and Raspberry Pi. No mining rigs. Small validator committees + device-aware rewards.
2) Prototype stack: JS node, block explorer, status service, rewards hub, JS/Rust SDKs. Profiles for desktop/server/gateway/mobile/superlight.
3) Try it: API <url> | Explorer <url> | Status <url> (tokens optional). Repo ships installers, Docker, and full-stack tests.
4) It’s experimental—feedback on performance/security welcome. #PoS #selfhosted #web3

## LinkedIn blurb (partners/integrators)
We’re announcing BulenCoin, an experimental Proof of Stake network designed for everyday hardware. Clients run on phones, laptops, servers, and Raspberry Pi; no GPUs or mining rigs. The stack includes a JS node, block explorer, status service, rewards hub, plus SDKs for JS and Rust. Profiles cover full/gateway/light/superlight modes with device-aware rewards. Installers, Docker, and end-to-end tests are public. Live endpoints: API <url>, explorer <url>, status <url>. Looking for partners/integrators to pressure-test performance and security.

## Key facts (reuse anywhere)
- Runs on phone → Pi → laptop/server (profiles: full/gateway/light/superlight).
- Small validator committees; device-class weighting; superlight mode prunes hard.
- Stack: BulenNode (JS), explorer, status service, rewards hub, JS/Rust SDKs.
- One-command installers + Docker, full-stack tests in repo.
- Live: API <url>, explorer <url>, status <url>. Experimental; feedback welcome.

## One-liner for micropayments
“BulenCoin ships a built-in micropayments rail: create invoices, render BIP21 links/QRs, and verify status/webhooks via `/api/payments` and `/api/payment-link`, with JS/Rust SDKs included.”
