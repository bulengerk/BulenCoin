BulenCoin network and node design (English summary)

1. Project goal
BulenCoin is an experimental PoS network intended to run on everyday hardware: phones,
tablets, laptops, desktops, servers, and SBCs. It targets low resource use, predictable
uptime rewards, and simple operations.

2. Network model
- Lightweight Proof-of-Stake with small validator committees.
- Device profiles (mobile light, phone super-light, desktop/server full, gateway, raspberry)
  tune ports, block interval, pruning, faucet defaults, and reward weight.
- Emphasis on pruning/snapshots so constrained devices can participate.

3. Node roles
- Mobile light: headers + small state, can join committees if staked, battery/data aware.
- Phone super-light: observer/wallet-first, aggressive pruning and sleep on low battery.
- Full nodes (desktop/server): full history/state, consensus participation, serve light
  clients, may act as gateway.
- Gateway: public API with stricter limits and tokens.

4. Consensus and rewards
- Lottery over eligible validators using stake, device weight, reputation, randomness.
- Block producer builds from mempool, committee signs; finality after a few confirmed
  blocks.
- Rewards: block reward + fees + uptime component; configurable burn/ecosystem/producer
  fractions; slashing for equivocation and misbehaviour.

5. API highlights
- `/api/status`, `/api/health`, `/api/blocks`, `/api/accounts/:addr`, `/api/transactions`,
  `/api/payment-link`, `/api/payments`, `/api/rewards/estimate`, `/metrics`.
- Guardrails: request size limit, rate limits, optional signature requirement, faucet
  toggle, tokens for status/metrics, webhook HMAC signing, CORS allowlist.

6. Security and operations
- Use P2P token and version headers; tokens for status/metrics; TLS via reverse proxy.
- Non-root service user, log rotation, monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), backups of state
  snapshots.
- Telemetry is optional/disabled by default and should be anonymised if enabled.

7. Rollout phases
- Devnet/testnet with faucet on and relaxed settings.
- Public testnet with signatures required, faucet off on gateways, rate limits tightened.
- Audit, then mainnet bootstrap with delegation and reduced team control over time.
