# BulenCoin Messaging

## Tone of voice

- Confident but not hyped; transparent about experimental status.
- Plain English first; avoid heavy jargon; show data when making claims.
- Highlight safety defaults (tokens/TLS/rate limits) and inclusivity of devices.

## Key claims (tight)

- “Runs on everyday hardware” – phones/tablets/laptops/servers share the same chain.
- “Security-first defaults” – P2P tokens/handshake, TLS-ready, signed webhooks, rate limits.
- “Uptime earns” – honest availability is rewarded; telemetry badges for community transparency.
- “Open-source, tested” – node + explorer + status with integration tests and guardrails.
- “Audit-bound roadmap” – public testnet first, then audits/bug bounty before mainnet.

## Boilerplate (short)

“BulenCoin is a lightweight Proof of Stake network built to run on everyday hardware – from phones
to servers. It rewards real nodes for honest uptime and ships with security defaults on by design
(tokens, TLS, rate limits). The stack is open-source (node, explorer, status) with integration
tests and a roadmap toward public audits and bug bounties.”

## Proof points to cite

- Device spectrum: mobile-light, gateway, desktop/server profiles.
- Guardrails: status/metrics tokens, webhook signatures, P2P token + handshake, optional TLS/QUIC.
- Testing: full-stack tests, docker sim, security tests in CI.
- Operations: install guide + docker compose; status/explorer endpoints; telemetry off by default.
- Roadmap: testnet → audit/bug bounty → mainnet with published parameters.
