# BulenCoin – short press note (template)

**What:** BulenCoin is a lightweight Proof of Stake network built to run on everyday hardware –
from phones and tablets to laptops and servers. It rewards real nodes for honest uptime and keeps
security defaults on by design.

**Why it matters:** Most crypto networks assume powerful, always-on servers. BulenCoin experiments
with spreading consensus across diverse devices, lowering the barrier to running a node and making
the network more resilient to centralized infrastructure failures.

**Proof points:** open-source stack (node + explorer + status), integration tests, security
guardrails (tokens/TLS, rate limits, signed webhooks), roadmap to audits and public testnet.

**Get started:** docs, Docker/installer builds, mobile light profile (beta) and a rewards hub for
telemetry badges. Project site: https://bulencoin.example
