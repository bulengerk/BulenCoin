# BulenCoin Press Kit & Brand Guidelines

This folder holds lightweight brand assets and usage notes for BulenCoin. It will grow as the
project matures; keep files small, vector-first and ready for embedding in docs/blog posts.

## Contents

- `logo/` – logo variants (SVG/PNG), dark/light backgrounds.
- `colors.md` – palette and usage notes.
- `typography.md` – headings/body/pill text recommendations.
- `press_note.md` – short press blurb template.

## Usage

- Use SVG wherever possible; fall back to PNG for social previews.
- Keep clear space equal to at least half the logo height on all sides.
- Do not alter colors, proportions or apply drop shadows to the logo mark.
- For third parties: link back to `https://bulencoin.example` and avoid implying endorsements.
